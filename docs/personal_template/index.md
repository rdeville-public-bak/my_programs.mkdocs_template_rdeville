# Setup Your Own Template

As you may have seen, the usage of this repo install a **really** basic
template, with little to no configuration, neither extra content such as extra
JS nor CSS.

But, you may want to use extra plugins such as [mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin] or
provide a basic README.md as well as licenses or a default file
`docs/_data/vars.yml` for all your documentation.

To do so, you will need to create your own template and use it. To learn how to
do, see:

- [Create your own template][create_custom_template]
- [Use your own template][use_custom_template]

Finally, you can see the [Example custom template][example_custom_template] to
give you hint about what can be done.
